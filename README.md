<strong>Bamazon</strong>
<br>

Bamazon is a CLI app that uses mySQL and Node.js to produce an Amazon-like storefront with both customer and manager options.

Customers are able to view and purchase products. The app takes in the customers' input, checks quantities available, and depletes inventory stock when an item is purchased.

Managers can view all product details, check low inventory, restock an item or create a new product line.
